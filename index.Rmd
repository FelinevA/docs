I am a PhD candidate in the [Lifespan Cognitive Dynamics lab](https://lifespancognitivedynamics.com/) and the [Developmental Psychobiology lab](https://dpblab.org/) at the Donders Institute. 

My PhD is part of the Learning Variability Network Exchange (LEVANTE) project, which is a really cool global project on variability. If that's something you are interested in as well, feel free to send me a message!
